Task Description:
Create a file called loops.py.  
Write a program that takes a non-negative integer as input and prints factorials up to that 
number using a loop. The factorial of a number is the multiplication of all the numbers less than 
the given number.  For example, 4 factorial is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 
The program should output in this format:  
1: 1 
2: 2 
3: 6 
4: 24 
5: 120 
6: 720

Description:
